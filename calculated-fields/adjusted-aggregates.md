# Adjusted Aggregates

When aggregate values are skewed by invalid data such as testing, internal traffic, or other identified means, the value of an aggregate field can be adjusted accordingly. This example is a static value, so it would assume the adjustment is accurate and up-to-date. If the skewing changed, this would have to be updated.
